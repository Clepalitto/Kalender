# Kalender

**Kalender** (still in early developpement) is a small calender project that *for now* can link dates and days of the week.
(But you can also see it as a simple calendar)

## How to use

In order to run Kalender, you need to build and run the file `main.cpp`.

Then, you just need to enter the data the programm asks for, and let it run !

It will generate the year, and after this process is complete, you can just type `Ctrl+F` to find which on which day your birthday is falling (that's just an example)

## About *contributing*

Of course, this project has **many** issues, and that is why everybody is welcome to contribute !

`"But what if I want to contribute, which features should I add then ?"` - would you say.

Here is a list of some good things I don't have the skills to add but can be added onto this project.

- UX and UI
- being able to generate several leap years would be cool ...

# So feel free to contribute ! ðŸ˜„
