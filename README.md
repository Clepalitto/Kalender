# Kalender

**Kalender** (still in early developpement) is a small calender project that *for now* can link dates and days of the week.
(But you can also see it as a simple calendar)

## How to use

This branch `beta` is a beta version of Kalender that lets you find the day linked to a special date.

For instance, if you enter `2 February 2023` , it will calculate and find the day. (In this case `Thursday`)
